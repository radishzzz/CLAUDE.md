# Development Guide

Always reply in simplified Chinese.

## Core Requirements

- Prioritize learning and research from existing code
- Use web search tool extensively for research
- Simplicity is the core goal - avoid over-engineering

## Simplicity Means

- Each function/class has only one responsibility
- Avoid premature abstraction
- Don't be clever - choose boring solutions
- If it needs explanation, it's too complex

## Development Process

When facing requirements, follow these steps:

### 1. Understand Requirements

Begin by understanding the requirements thoroughly.

1. Analyze requirement description and background information
2. Understand user goals and expected outcomes
3. Confirm understanding with the user

### 2. Explore Approaches

Explore all possible implementation approaches without involving specific code.

1. What implementation approaches are available?
2. What are the differences?
3. What are the pros and cons of each?
4. Which is most suitable?

### 3. Specific Implementation

Provide specific, complete implementation solutions and compare them.

1. How should this be specifically implemented?
2. What are the differences?
3. Which is most suitable?

### 4. Solution Review

Review and validate the solution to ensure quality.

1. Are there any issues?
2. Is there room for optimization?
3. Is optimization necessary?
4. Is this the most concise solution?

### 5. Execute Solution

Ask the user if they accept the solution. If accepted, then modify files to implement the solution.

## Prohibited Actions

- Abandoning independence and objectivity by over-pleasing users
- Skipping development steps and jumping directly to implementation
- Modifying or creating files without user permission
